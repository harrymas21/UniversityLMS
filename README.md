## University LMS

This is a simple online university learning management system. I created it in 2016(May - August).
In this project I did not use templating (header.php and footer.php). Major disadvantage!!! But I will re-create it with Laravel Framework later.

## It makes use of:
	-PHP
	-My SQL
	-Javascript

This system is an improved implementation of learning management system, it is simple to use for both lecturers and students.
## The scope of this system covers the following:
	-Internet-based access: All  users  who  have  internet  facility  can  access  the  system  wherever  and whenever they wish.
	-HTML 5 mobile app to login and enable participating in the forum easily using android platform.
	-Document management: System allows uploading and downloading of documents (pdfs, word documents, ppt).
	-Media management: System allows uploading and downloading of presentations, videos, voice recordings and pdf files.
	-Forums for students to chat and clarify taught issues.
	-Online quizzes and skill competitions to collect points for badge and leader-board system.
	-Dashboard displaying students from high skilled to least skilled based on previous points and skills undertaken.
	-Statistics(CAT,Quiz,Course) using libchart
	-SMS system to notify students whenever any material is posted in the document repository.

## Libraries used include:
	-Africa's Talking Bulky SMS API
	-FPDF library for pdf generation
	-LIBCHART library for graph generation.
	
## To use the system:
	-Install Wamp/xampp server.
	-Create a database "universitylms" in My SQL.
