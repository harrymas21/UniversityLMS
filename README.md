## University LMS

This is a simple online university learning management system. I created it in 2016(May - August).

	-Media management: System allows uploading and downloading of presentations, videos, voice recordings and pdf files.
	-Forums for students to chat and clarify taught issues.
	-Online quizzes and skill competitions to collect points for badge and leader-board system.
